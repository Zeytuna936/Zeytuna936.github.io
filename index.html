                        This chart illustrates the GDP growth in Türkiye over a period of more than 20 years. Although negative trend was experienced in the beginning of 2000s, the economy recovered sharply, reaching 15% growth in 2003. It saw the lowest point in 2009, when the growth decreased from 8% to -15% in a year. Followed by a sharp rise, the economy observed steady growth rate in the next 8 years. In 2020, there was a dramatic fall and then a rapid recovery in the next 2 years.

                            This chart illustrates the inflation in Germany from 1960 to 2020. The rate reached its peak in the end of 1970s. Following the second sharp increase in 1980, it experienced a dramatic fall and resulted with negative inflation rate in the middle of 1980s. From 1995 to 2019, it fluctuated around 1%. The sudden increase in inflation rate was observed in 2020.

                        The figure demonstrates that there is a positive trend for the use of renewables in the UK despite a sharp decline in 2020.

                    Although the trend for electricity production was positive, the output started to decline after 2010 probably due to shifts toward renewables.
