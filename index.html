                        This chart illustrates the GDP growth in Türkiye over a period of more than 20 years. Although negative trend was experienced in the beginning of 2000s, the economy recovered sharply, reaching 15% growth in 2003. It saw the lowest point in 2009, when the growth decreased from 8% to -15% in a year. Followed by a sharp rise, the economy observed steady growth rate in the next 8 years. In 2020, there was a dramatic fall and then a rapid recovery in the next 2 years.

                            This chart illustrates the inflation in Germany from 1960 to 2020. The rate reached its peak in the end of 1970s. Following the second sharp increase in 1980, it experienced a dramatic fall and resulted with negative inflation rate in the middle of 1980s. From 1995 to 2019, it fluctuated around 1%. The sudden increase in inflation rate was observed in 2020.

                    Although the trend for electricity production was positive, the output started to decline after 2010 probably due to shifts toward renewables.
